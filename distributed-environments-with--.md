# Distributed Environments

## Introduction to Distribution

---
---
---
---
---
What are the four key impacts of distribution on AI systems in games?
How does distribution affect the ability of AI agents to perceive the game world?
Why is distribution particularly important for large virtual environments in modern games?
---
---
---
---
---

### Why Distribution Matters for AI

Large virtual environments in modern games are typically distributed across multiple servers. This distribution fundamentally affects how AI systems operate within the game world.

**Key Impacts of Distribution:**
- **Tick rates**: The frequency at which the game state updates can vary across distributed components
- **Consistency**: Ensuring all players and AI agents see the same game state becomes challenging
- **Agent observations**: What AI agents can perceive may be limited by network latency and server boundaries
- **Gameplay analysis**: Any analysis of gameplay must account for distribution effects like lag and desynchronization

## Distributed Architectures

### Client-Server Architecture

---
---
---
---
---
What is the fundamental structure of client-server architecture in gaming?
What are the four main advantages of using client-server architecture?
How can zones be implemented in a client-server architecture?
What is the purpose of action/response multiplexers (proxies) in this architecture?
---
---
---
---
---

The most traditional and widely-used architecture in gaming.

**Structure:**
```
[Clients] ←→ [Game Server] ←→ [Game World Database]
              ↓
         [Account Management] ←→ [Account Database]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Game provider hosts servers in a computing center
- Client and server software are distinct and specialized
- Provides a centralized solution for critical functions

**Advantages:**
- **Centralized account management**: Single source of truth for player accounts
- **Clear world partitioning**: Easy to divide game world into zones/instances
- **Simplified monitoring**: All game state flows through central servers
- **Reliable persistence**: Centralized database for game state storage

**Detailed Implementation:**
- Multiple game servers can share the game state
- Zones can be implemented as:
  - **Shards/Realms**: Complete separate game worlds
  - **Instances**: Temporary copies of areas for small groups
- Division strategies:
  - **Strict division**: Hard boundaries between zones
  - **Seamless distribution**: Servers communicate to hide boundaries
- Action/response multiplexers (proxies) can reduce load on game servers

### Multi-Server Architecture

---
---
---
---
---
What are the key characteristics that distinguish multi-server architecture from traditional client-server?
What are the two main types of replication used in multi-server architectures?
What specific functions can proxy servers handle in this architecture?
---
---
---
---
---

An evolution of client-server that addresses scalability concerns.

**Characteristics:**
- Several servers work together
- Redundant data storage across servers
- Clients connect to geographically closer servers

**Dynamic Solutions:**
- **Replication**: Game state copied across multiple servers
  - Primary-backup replication for fault tolerance
  - Multi-master replication for load distribution
- **Proxy-Server**: Intermediate servers that handle specific functions
  - Authentication proxies
  - Action multiplexers
  - Regional gateways

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture

---
---
---
---
---
What are the main characteristics that define peer-to-peer architecture?
What are the three primary advantages of P2P architecture?
What are the main challenges faced when implementing P2P architecture for games?
---
---
---
---
---

A decentralized approach where all participants share responsibility.

**Characteristics:**
- No explicit server infrastructure
- Direct data exchange between adjacent peers
- Each peer hosts a portion of the game world
- Dynamic partitioning adjusts as peers join/leave

**Advantages:**
- No single point of failure
- Reduced infrastructure costs
- Natural scalability

**Challenges:**
- Consistency maintenance
- Cheat prevention
- NAT traversal issues

## Brewer's CAP Theorem

---
---
---
---
---
What are the three desired properties defined by the CAP theorem?
What does each property mean in the context of game systems?
What type of systems do most modern MMOs represent in terms of CAP theorem trade-offs?
Why can a distributed system only guarantee two of the three CAP properties?
---
---
---
---
---

A fundamental theorem that constrains distributed system design.

**The CAP Theorem states:** Any networked shared-data system can have at most two of the three desired properties:

1. **Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
   - Every read receives the most recent write
   - All players see the same game state

2. **Availability (A)**: System remains operational
   - Every request receives a response
   - Game remains playable even during failures

3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**: System continues despite network failures
   - Network can fail between nodes
   - Game handles network splits gracefully

**Implications for Game Design:**
- **CA Systems**: Traditional single-server games (sacrifice P)
- **CP Systems**: Turn-based games that can pause (sacrifice A)
- **AP Systems**: Most modern MMOs (sacrifice C)
  - Accept temporary inconsistencies
  - Use eventual consistency models
  - Implement conflict resolution mechanisms

## Protocol Content Types

### Action Result Protocol (Object Attributes)

---
---
---
---
---
What is the difference between absolute and relative updates in the action result protocol?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of each update type?
How do absolute updates ensure state consistency compared to relative updates?
---
---
---
---
---

Used to communicate state changes to clients.

**Absolute Updates:**
```
SET player_id="Facemelt0r" attribute="HP" value=96
```
- Directly sets the current value
- No ambiguity about final state
- Larger message size

**Relative Updates:**
```
MODIFY player_id="Facemelt0r" attribute="HP" delta=-100
```
- Sends only the change amount
- Smaller message size
- Risk of desynchronization if updates lost

### Action Request Protocol

---
---
---
---
---
What are the key characteristics of the action request protocol?
What are the five steps in server processing of an action request?
Why does this protocol enable server-authoritative gameplay?
---
---
---
---
---

Used for client-to-server communication of player intentions.

**Characteristics:**
- Contains only player input, no direct state changes
- Server calculates results based on current state
- Enables server-authoritative gameplay

**Example:**
```
ACTION player_id="Attacker" 
       type="ATTACK" 
       target="Facemelt0r" 
       skill="Uppercut"
```

**Server Processing:**
1. Receive action request
2. Validate action legality
3. Calculate results
4. Update game state
5. Send results to affected clients

## Client Solutions

### Thin Client Solution

---
---
---
---
---
What are the five phases in the thin client process flow?
What are the four main advantages of thin client architecture?
What are the four main disadvantages of this approach?
How does the thin client architecture handle game state authority?
---
---
---
---
---

**Architecture Overview:**
```
[Game Server]
- Holds complete game state
- Sole authority for changes
- Processes all game logic

[Clients]
- Display-only terminals
- Send input to server
- Receive state updates
```

**Detailed Process Flow:**
1. **Login Phase**: Client receives relevant game state subset
2. **Input Phase**: Client sends action requests to server
3. **Processing Phase**: Server queues and processes actions in order
4. **Update Phase**: Server calculates changes and updates state
5. **Distribution Phase**: Changes sent to affected clients

**Advantages:**
- **Consistency**: Single authoritative game state
- **Security**: Minimal cheating potential
- **Persistence**: Easy to save consistent states
- **Fairness**: Server-side processing ensures equal treatment

**Disadvantages:**
- **Latency**: Every action requires round-trip to server
- **Server Load**: All processing concentrated on server
- **Responsiveness**: Input lag affects player experience
- **Scalability**: Server becomes bottleneck

### Fat Client Solution

---
---
---
---
---
What authority do clients have in a fat client architecture?
What role does the server play in fat client solutions?
What are the main advantages and disadvantages of fat client architecture?
How do local game states behave in this architecture?
---
---
---
---
---

**Architecture Overview:**
```
[Clients]
- Own and manage their objects
- Process local actions immediately
- Send updates to server

[Server]
- Manages chronological ordering
- Distributes updates between clients
- Resolves conflicts
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Clients have authority over their own objects
- Server acts as message broker and timekeeper
- Local game states may temporarily diverge

**Advantages:**
- Reduced server load
- Better responsiveness for local actions
- Scalable processing power

**Disadvantages:**
- Consistency challenges
- Increased cheating potential
- Complex conflict resolution

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### The Fundamental Problem

---
---
---
---
---
What is the fundamental problem that conflict resolution mechanisms address in distributed systems?
How can the order of events appear different to different observers?
What happens in the example scenario when Client C's view lacks synchronization?
---
---
---
---
---

In distributed systems, the order of events can appear different to different observers.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Actual Timeline:
t0: Player S has 100/200 HP
t1: Player A heals S for 50 HP → 150/200 HP
t2: Player C hits S for 80 HP → 70/200 HP

Client C's View (without synchronization):
t0: S has 100/200 HP
t1: C hits S for 80 HP → 20/200 HP (local)
t2: Heal arrives late → Conflict! Is S at 20 or 70 HP?
```

### Solution 1: Optimistic/Pessimistic Game States

---
---
---
---
---
What are the two types of game states maintained in this solution?
What is the four-step process for handling conflicts?
How do local changes affect each type of state?
What happens when conflicts are detected?
---
---
---
---
---

**Implementation:**
```python
class ClientGameState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.optimistic = {}  # Contains local + unconfirmed changes
        self.pessimistic = {} # Contains only server-confirmed state
    
    def apply_local_change(self, change):
        self.optimistic.apply(change)
        # Pessimistic state unchanged
    
    def receive_server_update(self, update):
        self.pessimistic.apply(update)
        if conflicts_detected():
            self.optimistic = copy(self.pessimistic)
            # Re-apply pending local changes
```

**Process:**
1. Local changes update optimistic state immediately
2. Server confirmations update pessimistic state
3. On conflict, reset optimistic to pessimistic
4. Reapply any pending local changes

### Solution 2: Local Lag Mechanism

---
---
---
---
---
What is the core concept behind the local lag mechanism?
How does the implementation use a priority queue?
What is the key trade-off when adjusting lag time?
---
---
---
---
---

**Concept:** Delay processing to allow remote updates to arrive.

**Implementation:**
```python
class LocalLagBuffer:
    def __init__(self, lag_time):
        self.lag_time = lag_time
        self.event_queue = PriorityQueue()  # Sorted by timestamp
    
    def add_event(self, event, timestamp):
        self.event_queue.put((timestamp, event))
    
    def process_ready_events(self, current_time):
        while not self.event_queue.empty():
            timestamp, event = self.event_queue.peek()
            if current_time - timestamp >= self.lag_time:
                self.event_queue.get()
                process_event(event)
            else:
                break
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher lag = Better consistency
- Lower lag = Better responsiveness

### Solution 3: Time Synchronization

---
---
---
---
---
When does time synchronization become critical?
What are the three main approaches to time synchronization?
What does each approach accomplish?
---
---
---
---
---

For P2P and multi-server architectures, synchronizing time becomes critical.

**Approaches:**
1. **NTP Synchronization**: Use Network Time Protocol
2. **Logical Timestamps**: Lamport timestamps for ordering
3. **Vector Clocks**: Track causality between events

## Dead Reckoning

### Overview

---
---
---
---
---
What are the three core components of dead reckoning?
What is the primary purpose of using dead reckoning in games?
How does dead reckoning balance bandwidth usage and movement smoothness?
---
---
---
---
---

Dead reckoning is a technique for predicting object positions between updates to reduce network traffic while maintaining smooth movement.

**Core Components:**

1. **Update Strategy (Server-side)**
   - Determines when to send position updates
   - Balances bandwidth vs. accuracy

2. **Movement Model (Client-side)**
   - Predicts object movement between updates
   - Extrapolates based on last known state

3. **Error Correction (Client-side)**
   - Smoothly corrects prediction errors
   - Prevents visual "jumping"

### Update Strategies

#### 1. Regular Updates

---
---
---
---
---
What are the characteristics of regular update strategy?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
When might regular updates send unnecessary data?
---
---
---
---
---

```python
def regular_update_strategy(object, tick_rate=30):
    if tick % tick_rate == 0:
        send_position_update(object)
```
- Simple implementation
- Predictable bandwidth usage
- May send unnecessary updates

#### 2. Event-Based Updates

---
---
---
---
---
What triggers updates in an event-based strategy?
What are the main advantages and potential issues with this approach?
---
---
---
---
---

```python
def event_based_strategy(object):
    if object.direction_changed() or object.speed_changed():
        send_position_update(object)
```
- Efficient for predictable movement
- Low bandwidth for stationary objects
- May miss gradual changes

#### 3. Distance-Based Updates

---
---
---
---
---
How does distance-based updating determine update frequency?
What are the three zone definitions and their purposes?
What update frequencies are used for each zone in the example?
---
---
---
---
---

```python
def distance_based_strategy(object, viewer):
    distance = calculate_distance(object, viewer)
    
    if distance < CRITICAL_RANGE:
        update_frequency = 3  # Every 3 ticks
    elif distance < INTERACTION_RANGE:
        update_frequency = 15  # Every 15 ticks
    else:
        update_frequency = 30  # Every 30 ticks
    
    if tick % update_frequency == 0:
        send_position_update(object)
```

**Zone Definitions:**
- **Critical Range (0-50m)**: Combat distance, highest precision needed
- **Interaction Range (50-200m)**: Potential engagement zone
- **Visibility Range (200m+)**: Background objects

### Movement Models

#### Linear Movement with Constant Speed

---
---
---
---
---
What is the mathematical formula for predicting position with constant speed?
What do the variables in the formula represent?
How is the velocity vector calculated?
---
---
---
---
---

**Mathematical Model:**
```
p(t₁ + t_Δ) = p(t₁) + v⃗ × t_Δ

Where:
- v⃗ = [p(t₁) - p(t₀)] / (t₁ - t₀)  (velocity vector)
- Direction = v⃗ / |v⃗|              (unit vector)
- Speed = |v⃗|                      (magnitude)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def predict_linear_constant_speed(p0, p1, t0, t1, t_delta):
    velocity = (p1 - p0) / (t1 - t0)
    return p1 + velocity * t_delta
```

#### Linear Movement with Constant Acceleration

---
---
---
---
---
What is the mathematical formula for prediction with constant acceleration?
How many positions are needed to calculate acceleration?
What additional term appears in the formula compared to constant speed?
---
---
---
---
---

**Mathematical Model:**
```
p(t + t_Δ) = p(t) + v(t)×t_Δ + ½a(t)×t_Δ²

Where:
- a(t) = [v(t) - v(t-1)] / Δt  (acceleration)
- v(t) = [p(t) - p(t-1)] / Δt  (velocity)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def predict_linear_constant_acceleration(positions, times, t_delta):
    # Need at least 3 positions to calculate acceleration
    v1 = (positions[-1] - positions[-2]) / (times[-1] - times[-2])
    v0 = (positions[-2] - positions[-3]) / (times[-2] - times[-3])
    
    acceleration = (v1 - v0) / (times[-1] - times[-2])
    
    return positions[-1] + v1 * t_delta + 0.5 * acceleration * t_delta**2
```

### Error Correction with Hermite Curves

---
---
---
---
---
What are the four Hermite basis functions?
What does the interpolation formula use to create smooth transitions?
What is the four-step correction process?
Why is Hermite interpolation preferred over simple linear interpolation?
---
---
---
---
---

When predictions don't match server updates, smooth interpolation prevents jarring "teleports."

**Hermite Basis Functions:**
```
h₁(x) = 2x³ - 3x² + 1
h₂(x) = -2x³ + 3x²
h₃(x) = x³ - 2x² + x
h₄(x) = x³ - x²
```

**Interpolation Formula:**
```
p(x) = p(t)×h₁(x) + p'(t+Δt)×h₂(x) + d(t)×h₃(x) + d'(t)×h₄(x)

Where:
- p(t): Current predicted position
- d(t): Current predicted direction
- p'(t) + d'(t): Server update (position + direction)
- x ∈ [0, 1]: Interpolation progress
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def hermite_interpolation(p_current, d_current, p_target, d_target, progress):
    """Smooth interpolation between predicted and actual positions"""
    h1 = 2*progress**3 - 3*progress**2 + 1
    h2 = -2*progress**3 + 3*progress**2
    h3 = progress**3 - 2*progress**2 + progress
    h4 = progress**3 - progress**2
    
    return p_current*h1 + p_target*h2 + d_current*h3 + d_target*h4
```

**Correction Process:**
1. Detect prediction error when update arrives
2. Calculate correction trajectory
3. Apply correction over time period Δt
4. Slightly increase speed to "catch up"

## Network Protocols

### Game Requirements Analysis

#### Latency Tolerances by Genre

---
---
---
---
---
What are the maximum acceptable latencies for RTS, RPG, and FPS games?
Why do different game genres have different latency tolerances?
Which genre requires the lowest latency and why?
---
---
---
---
---

| Genre | Max Acceptable Latency | Reason |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| RTS | < 1000 ms | Turn-based nature, strategic planning |
| RPG | < 500 ms | Action timing less critical |
| FPS | < 100 ms | Twitch reflexes, precise aiming |

#### Bandwidth Requirements

---
---
---
---
---
What are the key observations about packet sizes and bandwidth in games?
How do update frequencies vary between different game types?
What is the relationship between game pace and bandwidth requirements?
---
---
---
---
---

**Real Game Data (from NetGames'07 study):**

| Game | Avg Packet Size | Packets/sec | Bandwidth | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Anarchy Online | 98 bytes | 1.58 | 2,168 bps | MMORPG, efficient protocol |
| World of Warcraft | 26 bytes | 3.19 | 2,046 bps | Highly optimized |
| Counter Strike | 36 bytes | 8.06 | 19,604 bps | Fast-paced FPS |
| Halo 3 | 247 bytes | 27.78 | 60,223 bps | Console, P2P elements |

**Key Observations:**
- Packet sizes typically small (< 100 bytes average)
- Update frequency varies dramatically by game type
- Total bandwidth remains modest even for action games

### TCP/IP Analysis

---
---
---
---
---
What are the main protocol characteristics of TCP/IP?
What are the four main disadvantages of TCP for gaming?
What optimizations can be applied to TCP sockets for gaming?
Why might head-of-line blocking be particularly problematic for games?
---
---
---
---
---

**Protocol Characteristics:**
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable delivery through retransmission
- In-order delivery guaranteed
- Flow control prevents overwhelming receiver
- Congestion control adapts to network conditions

**Advantages:**
- **Reliability**: Critical updates guaranteed delivery
- **Ordering**: Events arrive in sequence
- **Established**: Wide support, NAT traversal

**Disadvantages:**
- **Head-of-line blocking**: One lost packet delays all subsequent
- **Retransmission delay**: Outdated data still sent
- **Nagle's algorithm**: Artificially delays small packets
- **Slow start**: Takes time to reach full speed

**Optimizations:**
```python
# Disable Nagle's algorithm for lower latency
socket.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)

# Adjust send/receive buffers
socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_SNDBUF, 65536)
```

---
---
---
---
What are the five main characteristics of UDP protocol?
What are the main disadvantages of using UDP?
How can selective reliability be implemented on top of UDP?
What is the header size difference between UDP and TCP?
---
---
---
---
---

**Protocol Characteristics:**
- Connectionless (fire-and-forget)
- No delivery guarantees
- No ordering guarantees
- No congestion control
- Minimal overhead (8-byte header vs. 20+ for TCP)

**Advantages:**
- **Low latency**: No retransmission delays
- **Current data priority**: Old updates naturally dropped
- **Efficient**: Minimal protocol overhead
- **Flexible**: Build custom reliability where needed

**Disadvantages:**
- **Packet loss**: Must handle missing data
- **Out-of-order delivery**: Need sequence numbers
- **No congestion control**: Can overwhelm networks

**Typical Implementation:**
```python
class GameProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sequence = 0
        self.ack_buffer = {}
        
    def send_reliable(self, data, socket):
        """Implement selective reliability"""
        packet = {
            'seq': self.sequence,
            'type': 'reliable',
            'data': data
        }
        self.ack_buffer[self.sequence] = packet
        self.sequence += 1
        socket.sendto(serialize(packet), destination)
        
    def send_unreliable(self, data, socket):
        """Fast, lossy transmission"""
        packet = {
            'seq': self.sequence,
            'type': 'unreliable',
            'data': data
        }
        self.sequence += 1
        socket.sendto(serialize(packet), destination)
```

### Protocol Selection Guidelines

---
---
---
---
---
What are the four scenarios where TCP should be used?
What are the four scenarios where UDP is preferable?
What is the most common approach for protocol selection in games?
How does a hybrid approach utilize both protocols?
---
---
---
---
---

**Use TCP When:**
- Turn-based gameplay
- Critical state updates (inventory, trading)
- Chat and social features
- Login and authentication

**Use UDP When:**
- Real-time position updates
- Voice communication
- Non-critical visual effects
- High-frequency sensor data

**Hybrid Approach (Most Common):**
- TCP for reliable, ordered data
- UDP for time-sensitive updates
- Custom reliability layer for specific needs

# Persistence Systems

## Introduction to Persistence

### Why Persistence Matters

---
---
---
---
---
What are the two critical functions that persistence serves in games?
What are the main design considerations for save systems?
What challenges do high-frequency updates create for replay storage?
What enables each of the persistence functions (saves vs replays)?
---
---
---
---
---

Persistence serves two critical functions in games:

#### 1. Save (State Snapshots)
Saving a subset of the current game state (gs ∈ GS) enables:
- **Session continuity**: Resume gameplay after interruption
- **Crash recovery**: Restore consistent state after failures
- **Progress checkpointing**: Record advancement through content

**Design Considerations:**
- **Save locations**: Anywhere vs. designated save points
- **Save scope**: What gets preserved vs. reset
  - Player inventory and stats (always saved)
  - NPC positions (often reset)
  - World changes (selectively saved)
  - Random generation seeds (context-dependent)

#### 2. Replays (History Sequences)
Recording gameplay sequences (gs₁, gs₂, ..., gs_end) enables:
- **Performance analysis**: Study player strategies
- **Spectator features**: Broadcast competitive matches
- **Debug capabilities**: Reproduce bugs
- **Learning resources**: Teaching via examples

**Storage Challenges:**
- High-frequency updates generate large files
- Compression vs. seek performance trade-offs
- Client-side vs. server-side storage

### Requirements for Persistence Layers

---
---
---
---
---
What are the maximum acceptable timings for save initiation, per-tick overhead, and checkpoint completion?
What are the four consistency requirements (ACID) for persistence?
What are the main design factors that impact persistence implementation?
---
---
---
---
---

#### Performance Requirements
```
Maximum acceptable impact on game loop:
- Save initiation: < 1 ms
- Per-tick overhead: < 0.1 ms
- Checkpoint completion: < 100 ms
```

#### Consistency Requirements
- **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing saves
- **Consistency**: Valid game state relationships
- **Isolation**: Saves don't interfere with gameplay
- **Durability**: Completed saves survive crashes

#### Design Factors

| Factor | Impact | Considerations |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| State size | Storage & I/O time | Compression, selective saving |
| Update frequency | CPU & bandwidth | Batching, rate limiting |
| Recovery time | Player experience | Incremental loading |
| History depth | Storage capacity | Rotation policies |

## Persistence Methods

### State-Log Method

---
---
---
---
---
What is the core concept of the state-log method?
How do you calculate the storage rate for state-log persistence?
What are the main advantages and disadvantages of this method?
What causes the massive redundancy in state-log methods?
---
---
---
---
---

**Concept**: Periodically save complete game state snapshots.

**Implementation Example:**
```xml
<!-- Counter-Strike State Log Format -->
<replay duration="3379.459" ticks="101838">
  <tick time="1.0">
    <gamestate>
      <player id="1" name="Player1" team="CT">
        <position x="680" y="819" z="164"/>
        <angles pitch="2" yaw="60" roll="0"/>
        <health current="100" max="100"/>
        <armor current="100" max="100"/>
        <weapons>
          <primary model="ak47" ammo="30" reserve="90"/>
          <secondary model="glock" ammo="20" reserve="120"/>
        </weapons>
      </player>
      <!-- More players... -->
    </gamestate>
  </tick>
  <tick time="1.033">
    <!-- Complete state again -->
  </tick>
</replay>
```

**Storage Analysis:**
```
State size: S bytes
Tick rate: T ticks/second
Compression ratio: C (typically 0.1-0.3 for game data)

Storage rate = S × T × C bytes/second

Example: 1MB state, 30 ticks/sec, 0.2 compression
= 1MB × 30 × 0.2 = 6 MB/second = 360 MB/minute
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple implementation
- Fast random access to any point
- Self-contained snapshots
- Corruption affects single tick only

**Disadvantages:**
- Massive redundancy (typically 95%+)
- High I/O bandwidth required
- Large storage requirements

### Transition-Log Method

---
---
---
---
---
What is recorded in the transition-log method?
What are the three main compression techniques used?
What is the state reconstruction algorithm process?
What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to state-log?
---
---
---
---
---

**Concept**: Record only state changes between ticks.

**Format Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
  "changes": [
    {
      "entity": "player_15",
      "attribute": "position",
      "old_value": [100, 50, 0],
      "new_value": [105, 52, 0]
    },
    {
      "entity": "player_15",
      "attribute": "health",
      "old_value": 100,
      "new_value": 85
    }
  ]
}
```

**Compression Techniques:**
1. **Delta encoding**: Store differences instead of absolute values
2. **Run-length encoding**: Compress repeated values
3. **Attribute indexing**: Use IDs instead of strings

**State Reconstruction Algorithm:**
```python
def reconstruct_state(base_state, transitions, target_time):
    state = copy.deepcopy(base_state)
    
    for transition in transitions:
        if transition.timestamp > target_time:
            break
            
        entity = state.get_entity(transition.entity_id)
        entity.set_attribute(
            transition.attribute,
            transition.new_value
        )
    
    return state
```

**Advantages:**
- Dramatically reduced storage (10-50x)
- Bandwidth-efficient transmission
- Natural audit trail

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex reconstruction process
- Random access requires replay
- Corruption can cascade
- Must track all state changes

### Action-Log Method

---
---
---
---
---
What does the action-log method record?
What are the three requirements for action-log to work correctly?
What makes a simulation deterministic vs non-deterministic?
What are the main advantages and disadvantages of action-log persistence?
---
---
---
---
---

**Concept**: Record only player inputs and reconstruct state by replay.

**StarCraft II Example:**
```
Frame | Player      | Action
------|-------------|----------------------------------
0     | TSLHyuN     | Select Hatchery (10230)
0     | TSLHyuN     | Select Larva (1027c,10280,10284)
1     | TSLHyuN     | Train Drone
16    | TSLHyuN     | Select Drone ×6 (10234-10248)
17    | TSLHyuN     | Right-click Mineral Field (10114)
```

**Requirements for Action-Log:**
1. **Deterministic simulation**: Same inputs → same outputs
2. **Complete input capture**: All randomness must be recorded
3. **Fixed time step**: Consistent tick rate

**Determinism Challenges:**
```python
# NON-DETERMINISTIC (bad)
def spawn_enemy():
    return Enemy(
        position=random_position(),  # Uses system RNG
        health=random.randint(80, 120)
    )

# DETERMINISTIC (good)
def spawn_enemy(rng_state):
    return Enemy(
        position=seeded_random_position(rng_state),
        health=seeded_random_int(rng_state, 80, 120)
    )
```

**Advantages:**
- Minimal storage (KB/minute vs. MB/minute)
- Contains player intent, not just results
- Perfect reproduction of gameplay

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive state recovery (full replay)
- Requires perfect determinism
- Version compatibility issues
- No fast-forward without replay

## Persistence in Large Distributed Environments

### Unique Challenges

---
---
---
---
---
What are the scale differences between single-player and MMO persistence?
How do state size, update rate, concurrent saves, and consistency differ?
What makes persistence more challenging in distributed environments?
---
---
---
---
---

**Scale Differences:**
| Aspect | Single-Player | MMO |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| State size | 1-10 MB | 1-100 GB |
| Update rate | 10-60 Hz | 1-10 Hz |
| Concurrent saves | 1 | 1000s |
| Consistency | Local | Distributed |

### Database Approach

---
---
---
---
---
What are the main components of a relational database schema for games?
What are the four main advantages of using databases for persistence?
What are the main disadvantages of the database approach?
How are transactions used to maintain consistency?
---
---
---
---
---

**Relational Schema Example:**
```sql
-- Player state table
CREATE TABLE player_state (
    player_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    position_x FLOAT,
    position_y FLOAT,
    position_z FLOAT,
    health INT,
    mana INT,
    last_update TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_position (position_x, position_y)  -- Spatial queries
);

-- Inventory table (normalized)
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    player_id BIGINT,
    slot_id INT,
    item_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, slot_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES player_state(player_id)
);
```

**Transaction Example:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE player_state 
SET position_x = 100.5, position_y = 200.3, last_update = NOW()
WHERE player_id = 12345;

UPDATE inventory 
SET quantity = quantity - 1 
WHERE player_id = 12345 AND item_id = 9876;

COMMIT;
```

**Advantages:**
- ACID guarantees
- Mature technology
- Complex queries supported
- Built-in replication

**Disadvantages:**
- Transaction overhead
- Schema rigidity
- Impedance mismatch with objects

### Log-File Approach

---
---
---
---
---
How does the high-performance logging implementation work?
What binary format is used for compact storage?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of log-file persistence?
Why is sequential I/O important for this approach?
---
---
---
---
---

**High-Performance Logging:**
```python
class GameLogger:
    def __init__(self, filename, buffer_size=65536):
        self.file = open(filename, 'ab')  # Append binary
        self.buffer = bytearray(buffer_size)
        self.position = 0
        
    def log_change(self, entity_id, attribute, value, timestamp):
        # Create compact binary format
        entry = struct.pack(
            '!QIId',  # EntityID, AttributeID, Value, Timestamp
            entity_id,
            attribute,
            value,
            timestamp
        )
        
        # Buffer writes for performance
        if self.position + len(entry) > len(self.buffer):
            self.flush()
            
        self.buffer[self.position:self.position+len(entry)] = entry
        self.position += len(entry)
        
    def flush(self):
        self.file.write(self.buffer[:self.position])
        self.position = 0
```

**Advantages:**
- Maximum write performance
- Sequential I/O optimal
- Simple implementation
- No lock contention

**Disadvantages:**
- No immediate consistency
- Complex recovery process
- No query capabilities
- Manual index management

### Hybrid Architecture

---
---
---
---
---
What are the five main components of a hybrid persistence architecture?
What is the implementation flow from game server to queryable state?
What are the benefits of using a hybrid approach?
How does this architecture minimize game loop impact?
---
---
---
---
---

**System Design:**
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ Game Server │────▶│ Log Buffer   │────▶│ Log Files  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────┬──────┘
                                                │
                    ┌──────────────┐            ▼
                    │   Database   │◀────┌─────────────┐
                    └──────┬───────┘     │ ETL Process │
                           │             └─────────────┘
                           ▼
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │ Query Cache  │
                    └──────────────┘
```

**Implementation Flow:**
1. **Game Server**: Writes to memory-mapped log buffer
2. **Log Writer**: Flushes to disk asynchronously
3. **ETL Process**: Extracts, transforms, loads into DB
4. **Database**: Provides queryable, consistent state
5. **Cache Layer**: Accelerates common queries

**Benefits:**
- Minimal game impact (< 0.01ms/write)
- Eventual consistency with ACID guarantees
- Rich query capabilities
- Fault tolerance through redundancy

## Checkpoint Recovery Methods

### Overview

---
---
---
---
---
What is the goal of checkpoint recovery methods?
What are the four key metrics for evaluating checkpoint methods?
How do these metrics affect game performance?
---
---
---
---
---

**Goal**: Create consistent snapshots with minimal game loop impact.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Checkpoint latency**: Time to initiate checkpoint
- **Checkpoint duration**: Time to complete checkpoint
- **Memory overhead**: Additional RAM required
- **CPU overhead**: Processing time per tick

### Method 1: Naive-Snapshot

---
---
---
---
---
How does the naive-snapshot algorithm work?
What is the performance analysis in terms of copy time and memory usage?
When should naive-snapshot be used?
What causes the periodic lag spikes?
---
---
---
---
---

**Algorithm:**
```python
class NaiveSnapshot:
    def __init__(self, game_state_size):
        self.game_state = bytearray(game_state_size)
        self.shadow_copy = bytearray(game_state_size)
        self.writer_busy = False
        
    def update(self, offset, value):
        self.game_state[offset] = value
        
    def checkpoint(self):
        if not self.writer_busy:
            # Copy entire state (expensive!)
            self.shadow_copy[:] = self.game_state[:]
            self.writer_busy = True
            start_async_write(self.shadow_copy)
```

**Performance Analysis:**
- Copy time: O(state_size)
- Memory usage: 2× base requirement
- Causes periodic lag spikes

**When to Use:**
- Small game states (< 100MB)
- Infrequent checkpoints
- Simplicity more important than performance

### Method 2: Copy-on-Update (Selective Copy)

---
---
---
---
---
How does selective copy differ from naive-snapshot?
What do the dirty flags track?
What is the performance improvement compared to naive-snapshot?
What limitation does this method still have?
---
---
---
---
---

**Data Structure:**
```python
class SelectiveCopy:
    def __init__(self, num_objects):
        self.objects = [GameObject() for _ in range(num_objects)]
        self.dirty_flags = [False] * num_objects
        self.shadow_objects = [None] * num_objects
        
    def update_object(self, index, new_value):
        self.objects[index] = new_value
        self.dirty_flags[index] = True
        
    def checkpoint(self):
        # Only copy dirty objects
        for i, is_dirty in enumerate(self.dirty_flags):
            if is_dirty:
                self.shadow_objects[i] = copy.deepcopy(self.objects[i])
                self.dirty_flags[i] = False
                
        start_async_write(self.shadow_objects)
```

**Performance Analysis:**
- Copy time: O(changed_objects)
- Memory usage: 2× changed objects only
- Still has checkpoint spike

### Method 3: Wait-Free Zigzag

---
---
---
---
---
What are the main components of the wait-free zigzag data structure?
How do the write and read flags work?
What happens at checkpoint end?
Why is no locking needed in this approach?
---
---
---
---
---

**Complex Data Structure:**
```python
class WaitFreeZigzag:
    def __init__(self, num_objects):
        # Two complete game states
        self.states = [
            [GameObject() for _ in range(num_objects)],
            [GameObject() for _ in range(num_objects)]
        ]
        
        # Flags for each object
        self.write_flags = [0] * num_objects  # MW: which state to write
        self.read_flags = [0] * num_objects   # MR: which state to read
        
    def update_object(self, index, new_value):
        # Write to state indicated by write flag
        state_index = self.write_flags[index]
        self.states[state_index][index] = new_value
        # Update read flag to match
        self.read_flags[index] = state_index
        
    def read_object(self, index):
        # Read from state indicated by read flag
        state_index = self.read_flags[index]
        return self.states[state_index][index]
        
    def checkpoint_end(self):
        # Flip write flags for unchanged objects
        for i in range(len(self.write_flags)):
            if self.write_flags[i] == self.read_flags[i]:
                self.write_flags[i] = 1 - self.write_flags[i]
```

**Algorithm Flow:**
1. Updates write to current write state
2. Writer reads from previous write state
3. At checkpoint end, flip unchanged object flags
4. No locking needed!

**Performance:**
- No copy overhead
- Memory usage: 2× base requirement
- Bit manipulation overhead

### Method 4: Wait-Free Ping-Pong

---
---
---
---
---
What is the triple-buffer design of wait-free ping-pong?
How does checkpoint swap work in this method?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
Why does this method achieve true wait-free operation?
---
---
---
---
---

**Triple-Buffer Design:**
```python
class WaitFreePingPong:
    def __init__(self, num_objects):
        # Three complete states
        self.game_state = [GameObject() for _ in range(num_objects)]
        self.even_state = [GameObject() for _ in range(num_objects)]
        self.odd_state = [GameObject() for _ in range(num_objects)]
        
        self.write_to_odd = False  # Which persistence state to write
        
    def update_object(self, index, new_value):
        # Always update game state
        self.game_state[index] = new_value
        
        # Update current persistence write state
        if self.write_to_odd:
            self.odd_state[index] = new_value
        else:
            self.even_state[index] = new_value
            
    def checkpoint_swap(self):
        # Just flip the write target
        self.write_to_odd = not self.write_to_odd
        
        # Writer reads from the non-write state
        if self.write_to_odd:
            start_async_write(self.even_state)
        else:
            start_async_write(self.odd_state)
```

**Advantages:**
- Zero copy overhead
- No bit manipulation
- Constant-time checkpoint swap
- True wait-free operation

**Disadvantages:**
- 3× memory requirement
- Cache efficiency concerns
